-> After numerous unsuccessful searches to find a solution to get Tinyjoypad-compatible
 games to work on the standard ATtiny85 microcontroller, I decided to focus on the
 essential steps to make the games work on the ATtiny85. Now that my work is complete,
 I would like to share it with the community ;) Simply replace the TinyDriver.h file with this one!
